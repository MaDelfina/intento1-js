Here's a simplistic rundown:

public means the web accessible root of the site. Basically whatever is in that folder can be opened from browser address bar. Server won't provide user access to files outside public

build is where compiled version of assets are placed when you run npm build. This is what will get delivered to user

src (short for "source") contains your working files that will be used later to create the build
